//: Hi there! Welcome to my submission for the WWDC 2017 scholarship. This playground file loads up a class, AboutMe. AboutMe is contained within AboutMe.swift, and is responsible for introducing me and loading up the game. GameScene.swift contains the code for my SpriteKit game. roundedView.swift is a simple view that I use in the presentation. I've sorted all the code into multiple files for organizational purposes, so all the code is contained in those three files.

let ab = AboutMe()
ab.load()
